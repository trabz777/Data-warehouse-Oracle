# Data-warehouse-Oracle-12c
A data warehouse build using Oracle 12c. The source data was provided as Microsoft Access database (locemdat_CW).
Full project report is also included in the repository as 'DW Project Report.docx', read it for full understanding of the project. 


The National Health Service (NHS) gives funding each year to local agencies to provide temporary staff to cover for doctors and general practitioners when they are either on holiday or absent from the workplace due to illness or any other reason. When a surgery, has a vacancy they contact an agency, by phone, and request a doctor, called a locum, to cover for a given period, called a session. NHS have been given a database (MS Access) of an agency and they want to get useful information out of it but the database is not in right structure. The data inside needs to be cleaned and the schema also requires to be changed to carry out necessary transactions. 
As a Datawarehouse specialists, NHS have asked us to carry out the ETL process and output the required information from the database of agency.  We divided the project into 4 parts â€“ Importing, Implementing, Cleaning and Loading of data. In this report we will demonstrate how we were able to fulfil requirements of NHS by building a Data warehouse for them. We will be using Oracle 12c for building the Data warehouse.
